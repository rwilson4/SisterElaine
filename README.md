[Vale](https://vale.sh/)-compatible rules inspired by my high school
English teacher, Sr. Elaine Freund. Avoid wiggle words like 'really',
'very', and 'that'. Eschew 'be verbs' in favor of more descriptive
verbs. And don't start a sentence with 'and'!

I have also included a few data-science rules. I sometimes type
"casual" when I mean "causal". The word "significant" should only be
used with reference to "statistical significance".

I used the [Microsoft](https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft) rules
as a starting point in some instances.
